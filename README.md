# SUTDTerm6Simulation

### At a glance
Our team’s primary objective is to model the queueing system of one of our school’s most popular cafeteria, Crooked Cooks.
We have analyzed and segregated the queues in Crooked Cooks to mainly 4 queues: 
the food queue, drinks queue, darts queue and also the queue for the studying/relax area.
The queues are interlinked as customers can sometimes do more than one activity in Crooked cooks.

Our goal is to formulate a more complex simulation based on the doctor-clinic example that we were taught in class.
Additional ideas would be to include a button to toggle between peak and non-peak hours as well as different days of the week.
